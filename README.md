# goit-js-hw-02

This project was developed to strengthen foundational JavaScript skills by implementing dynamic behavior within a static HTML context as part of the GoIT curriculum.

In accordance with essential JavaScript and frontend development principles:

- JavaScript is used to manipulate DOM elements and to handle interactive logic associated with the HTML page structure.
- Script files are organized in a dedicated `js/` directory to reinforce modular code organization and separation of concerns.
- Standard coding conventions are applied to improve readability and maintainability, including clear function naming and consistent formatting.
- The project is designed to function without external libraries, focusing on pure JavaScript techniques.
- All HTML and related JavaScript resources are organized to support further enhancements in later modules.

This repository represents the second assignment in the GoIT JavaScript module and demonstrates core application of basic scripting, DOM interaction, and client‑side behavior patterns.
